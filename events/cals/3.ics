SUMMARY:Fermentation!
DESCRIPTION:Make natural carbonated beverages from berries and root vegetab
 les. For example: ginger soda is as simple as grating ginger into sugar wat
 er and letting it sit long enough! We will make kombucha and kefir from SCO
 BYs (symbiotic colonies of bacteria and yeast). Come for the soda, stay for
  your intestinal tract's health.
